jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, ubuntu-20.04]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Add Step Here
        uses: im-open/this-repo@v1
        with:
          input-1: 'abc'
          input-2: '123
```

## Recompiling

If changes are made to the action's code in this repository, or its dependencies, you will need to re-compile the action.

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build

# Bundle the code (if dependencies are already installed)
npm run bundle
```

These commands utilize [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#bundling-for-node) to bundle the action and
its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.
