# update-deployment-board

This action creates a visual representation of deployments on a Project board in your GitHub repository.  When this action is included in a workflow that does a deployment it will generate or update an existing issue and include it on the specified project board.  

<kbd><img src="./docs/project-board.png"></img></kbd>

When the action runs it will label the issue with two labels
  1. `ðŸš€currently-in-<dev|qa|stage|prod|other-provided-env>` 
     - This label makes it visually easy to see which branch, tag or SHA was most recently deployed to a specific environment and it is meant to stay with the card representing code that is currently deployed to that environment.  
     - In the screenshot above, the issue for `Tag Deploy: v2.1` has the labels for `ðŸš€currently-in-qa` and `ðŸš€currently-in-stage` because that code is deployed to both environments.  The label will stay on a card even if it moves to another column until a different branch, tag or SHA is deployed to that environment.
  2. Deployment Status `success|failure|skipped|cancelled`. 
     - The status matches the possible values for step outcomes and this cannot be changed. 


The issue will contain a list of deployments for the ref which include the environment, a link to the workflow run, the status, date of deployment and the actor who kicked off the workflow.

## Project Board
Before using this action, a Project board must be set up.
- The board will need one column per environment and the name should match the environments you will provide with the action.
  - If the columns don't exist or don't match the environment name used with the action, it will fail.
- The board on this repository can be cloned by opening [the board], opening the `â‰¡ Menu`, clicking on the `...` then selecting `Copy`.
  - Chose a new Owner by typing in the owner/repository you want to add the board to.
  - Update the board name and description if desired.
  - Once the board has been copied over update, delete or add columns as necessary.

If the repository has multiple deployables, like a database and app service, separate boards can be set up for each.

## Action Conventions
- The action assumes the repository where issues are created and updated is the repository where the action is run.
- The action will check to see if certain labels exist in the repository and create them if they don't.
- When an issue is generated a comment is added tagging the GitHub login responsible for creating that issue, this defaults to `@github-actions` unless another login is specified.  The intent of this comment is to cut down on the number of issues and data the action has to process when looking for an existing issue to update.  
- The action will only look through the last 100 issues that meet its search criteria to find what it needs.
- Using `continue-on-error: 'true'` may be helpful for this step since you might not want the job or workflow to fail if the board did not update correctly.
- When the `ref-type` argument is not provided the action will do some regex pattern matching to try to find the right ref type.  It will check in this order:
  - SHA: `/\b([0-9a-f]{40})\b/g`
     - Matches - a full SHA from your git commit
  - Tag: `/^(v?\d+(?:\.\d+)*.*)$/g`
     - Matches:
       - v1, v1.0, v1.0.0, v1.0.0-test1
       - 2, 2.0, 2.0.0, 2.0.0-test2
  - Branch: Default when the SHA or Tag pattern do not match

## Recompiling

If changes are made to the action's code in this repository, or its dependencies, you will need to re-compile the action.

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build

# Bundle the code (if dependencies are already installed)
npm run bundle
```

These commands utilize [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#bundling-for-node) to bundle the action and
its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.
